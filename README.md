# Tetris Clone - Assignment 1 - CSC2003S

## Description
A clone of the original tetris. Made for my first game development assignment.

It uses the [libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) engine.

The font, [Novamono](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Nova+Mono), is used for all on screen text(including the tetris blocks and grid).

## Instructions
When you run the project, the main class must be `com.mygdx.game.desktop.DesktopLauncher`
and the working directory must be `core/assets/`
