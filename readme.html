    <p>A clone of the original tetris. Made for my first game development assignment.</p>
    <p>Its art-style and gameplay was based on the original tetris and was kept as simplistic as
        possible.</p>
    <p>It uses:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">libGDX</a> engine.</li>
        <li>The font, <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Nova+Mono">Novamono</a>, is used for all on
            screen text(including the tetris blocks and grid).</li>
        <li><a href="http://youtube.com/findAuthor">Chiptunes Do Dubstep - ASDF</a> for background music.</li>
        <li><a href="findLink">Beep SF</a> and <a href="findLink">Click SF</a> as sound effects.</li>

    <p>The gameplay involves the player moving and positioning the various pieces in an attempt to complete
        rows and avoid the blocks stacking to the top of the play area.</p>
    <p>The player starts out with 0 points on level 1. As the completes rows, places pieces (or drops
        them) they get points. When the points pass <code>level * 1000</code> the player levels up.</p>
    <p>Levelling up increases the gravity which controls the speed of the blocks descent as well as the
        number of points received for placing a block.</p>
    <p>The speed at which the block falls is: <code>800ms / (gravity * gravityModifier)</code></p>
    <p>The gravityModifier is used to speed up the block when the player push on the <code>DOWN</code> arrow key.</p>
    <p>The player can move the blocks left or right and the blocks can be rotated by pushing the <code>UP</code>
        arrow key.</p>
    <p>If the player wishes, a single block can be stored by pushing <code>LEFT SHIFT</code>. If there is already a
        stored block, the current block and stored block are swapped. Once a player has stored or
        swapped a block, they can only do it again once they have place their new block. Swapping the
        block provides a tactical edge as the new block starts at the top of the screen and it allows
        you to save a piece you think you might need or swap out a useless block.</p>
    <p>The player can drop the block from its current position. It will stop when it collides with the
        floor or another block. The player gets points depending on the height the block drops from, so
        you get more points by dropping the block instead of letting it fall.</p>
    <p>The player receives points when a row is completed, the points gained are calculated as follows:
        <code>(50 * rowsRemoved)</code>. So the more rows completed at once, the more points gained. When a block
        lands, the player gets 25 points.</p>
    <p>After the blocks land, there is a time (the same as the rate at which the block falls) in which the
        block can be moved.</p>
    <p>Finally, once the game is over, if the player has amassed enough points, more than the person
        with the least points on the high score list, they will be prompted to enter their name. Their
        score will be recorded and added to the list. The list is saved using the libGDX engine to the
        local PC so the highscore list is persistent on the current PC.</p>
